                    This map viewer presents the results of the resource mapping of orthomagmatic mineral deposits in
                    Europe.
                    This task was part of the Work Package 5 of the SEMACRET project. Data were systematically
                    collected,
                    reviewed, complemented and evaluated between November 2023 and February 2025. As the source of
                    information
                    were used existing national and EU databases as were as other additional literature (articles, press
                    releases, reports, etc.). It covers EU and associated European countries (Norway, South Balkan
                    countries) as
                    well Greenland, associated with the EU thorough Denmark as overseas territory which recently signed
                    strategic partnership on sustainable raw materials value chains with the EU.
                </p>
                <p>The map shows different types of mineralizations associated with orthomagmatic mafic-ultramafic
                    mineral systems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sulphide Ni-Cu dominated mineralization with possible Co, Cr and/or PGE by-products</li>
                    <li>Oxide (Fe)-Ti-V mineralizations (with Ti/V rich magnetite, rutile or ilmenites)</li>
                    <li>Chrome ores</li>
                    <li>PGE dominated (reef type) mineralizations that might be associated with other precious and base
                        metals (Au, Ag, Cu, Ni)</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The database that has been created to this purpose contains basic information, localization with
                    coordinates, characterization of occurrence type, resource quantities (if available), including
                    UNFC<sup>1</sup>. In addition to the basic information, for majority of points is available a link
                    to
                    passport
                    with more detailed information.</p>

                <p>The map viewer allows to filter data by different attributes, such as occurrence type (deposit,
                    prospect, occurrence), mine status (operating, under development, not operating) or importance (very
                    large, large, medium, small) which are based on INSPIRE Mineral Resources Theme
                    definitions<sup>2</sup> .
                    Other
                    filter options are by mineralization type or by classification method applied for the resource
                    estimate.</p>

                <p>To learn more about the specific definitions applied in the map viewer and the passports see the

            <p><b>Occurrence ID</b> – unique identifier of each mineral occurrence in the database</p>
            <p><b>Occurrence name</b> – name or names under which the occurrence or deposit is
                known/registered in other databases or literature</p>
            <p><b>Country</b> – name of the country, where the occurrence is placed</p>
            <p><b>Occurrence type</b> – based on INSPIRE Mineral Occurrence Type 2 with corresponding
                definitions of occurrence, prospect and mineral deposit in relation to the level of knowledge
                and economic potential</p>
            <p><b>Mineralization type</b> – usual association of valuable elements (metals) in this type of
                mineralization (mentioned elements are not necessarilly present in this occurrence)</p>
            <p><b>Importance</b> – Importance of the deposit based on INSPIRE Importance Value (European
                Commission, 2024). Express the classification of deposit size of the deposit according to the
                commodity quantity. Class boundaries are based on a statistical study of a large set of
                deposits throughout the world and defines what is a very large, a large, a medium-sized etc.
                deposit for this commodity.</p>
            <p><b>Classification method</b> – classification method applied in the most recent resource estimate
                 CRIRSCO-compliant – resource estimate applies classification in line with CRIRSCO - family
                reporting standard. The current holder is the one who has issued or confirmed the estimate,
                thus it is considered CRIRSCO-compliant.
                 Historic CRIRSCO – resources have been classified according to the CRIRSCO-family standard,
                however, the company has left the tenement or there has been an ownership change
                without amending the resource estimate. Such estimates are usually referred as historic or
                foreign and are not considered CRIRSCO-compliant sensu stricto.
                 Non-compliant/historic – the resource estimate is not in line with any CRIRSCO-family
                reporting standard and related classification. The classification might be in line with some
                national standard, or it is a historic/not standardized classification
                 No resource estimate – the resource estimate does not exist (is not known).
            </p>
            <p><b>Estimation date</b> – date of the issue of the estimate. In the case of CRIRSCO-compliant
                estimates, the Effective date is provided. In the case that only year is known, the date 31.12.
                + year is used.</p>
            <p><b>Total ore (t)</b> – total tonnage of all resource and reserves categories, based on the most
                recent available estimate (the last estimate for which the tonnages and grades has been
                available, based on the literature).</p>
            <p><b>Best UNFC class</b> - the UNFC class that best represents the Project development status and
                overall confidence in the resource estimate. For CRIRSCO-compliant resource estimates, the
                UNFC class is not displayed.</p>
            <p><b>Best UNFC amount</b> – Proportion of commodity quantities, that corresponds to the Best
                UNFC class.</p>
            <p><b>Additional UNFC class + Additional quantities</b> - The project itself may contain additional
                commodity quantities with different UNFC classes.</p>
            <p><b>INSPIRE Mine Status</b> – status of the mine development based on INSPIRE Mine Status 3 with
                corresponding definitions of operating, under development, not operating</p>
